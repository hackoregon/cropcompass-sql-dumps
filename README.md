## Git LFS
The SQL dump we generated tonight, `agtechdump2016-06-09.sql`, is 141 megabytes. GitHub has an upper limit of 100 MB for a file upload using the normal operations. Instead, we need to use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS). Here's the GitHub help page: <https://help.github.com/articles/versioning-large-files/> and the install page for the tool: <https://git-lfs.github.com/>.

I installed this on my workstation and uploaded the file. You should not need this extra tool to download the file. Just browse to the file <https://github.com/hackoregon/cropcompass-sql-dumps/blob/master/agtechdump2016-06-09.sql> and press the "Raw" button. You should get a download / save dialog.
